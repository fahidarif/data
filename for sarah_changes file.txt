In the Downloadables section, there is a file called sarah_changes.sh, which contains code to make it look like Sarah has 
modified your fork on GitHub. To run the code, download the file, then using Git Bash or your terminal, cd to the 
directory where you've saved it. Then type bash sarah_changes.sh followed by a space, followed by the url to your fork.
 For example, if Caroline were running the code, she would type bash sarah_changes.sh https://github.com/cbuckey-uda/recipes.git, 
but you should use the url for your fork, not Caroline's fork. If you haven't set up password caching, 
then you will be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password.
